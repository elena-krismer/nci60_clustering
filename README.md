## Cluster NCI-60 celllines/models: Angiogenesis related Geneexpression, CMP-N-Acetylneuraminate/Gangliosid pathway activity

In order to describe a correlation between Angiogenesis and the activity of CMP-N-Acetylneuraminate/Gangliosid pathways in Carciogenesis and Metastation transcriptomic data from the [NCI60- Cellines](https://discover.nci.nih.gov/cellminer/home.do) was used. Pathway activities were determined from the Genome Scale Metabolic Models from [Yizhal et al.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4238051/). (Integrated transcriptomic data + growth rates, Validation of models using Metabolite Secretion/Uptake).

Since the [Gene Set Enrichment Analysis](https://github.com/elena-krismer/GSEA_nci60) didn't work out, in this approach we tried to find some patterns using Prinicipal Component Analysis and hierarchial Clustering. (spoiler also didn't work :))
